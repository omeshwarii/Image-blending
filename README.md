# Image Blending

The project involved implementing Laplacian blending, a technique for seamlessly merging images without visible seams. The process included creating Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, blending images using a mask, and iteratively reconstructing the final blended image. This approach ensured a smooth transition between images, making the merged result appear as if it were a single, cohesive image without any noticeable boundaries.
